# MCP LlamaIndex SQLite Bridge

A comprehensive demonstration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) with SQLite integration and LlamaIndex client, featuring both a simple demo and a full-featured HR Management System.

## Overview

This project showcases how to build and use MCP servers that expose database operations as tools, connected via LlamaIndex-based clients with Ollama LLM support. It includes:

1. **Simple Demo** - Basic SQLite server with simple people table
2. **HR Management System** - Advanced natural language HR system with employee management, leave tracking, compensation, and analytics

### Components

#### Simple Demo:
- **server.py**: Basic MCP server with SQL tools for a simple people database
- **client.py**: LlamaIndex client for natural language database interactions

#### HR Management System:
- **hr_server.py**: Advanced MCP server with comprehensive HR tools
- **hr_client.py**: Sophisticated client with context-aware natural language processing
- **HR_USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Detailed documentation with examples

## Features

### Core Features
- MCP server architecture with SQLite integration
- Natural language interface using LlamaIndex and Ollama
- Async support for both server and client
- Tool-based approach for database operations

### HR Management System Features
- **Employee Management**: Add, update, search, and manage employee records
- **Leave Management**: Request, approve, and track employee leave balances
- **Compensation**: Salary updates, compensation reports, and payroll analytics
- **Organization Structure**: Org charts, department management, and transfers
- **Analytics**: HR dashboards, turnover analysis, and diversity metrics
- **Performance Reviews**: Create and track performance evaluations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all HR actions for compliance

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running
- llama3.2 model (or another model that supports tool calling)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements

### Email is REQUIRED When Adding Employees
The HR system **requires an email address** when adding new employees. Commands without email will fail.

‚ùå **WRONG**: `Add John Doe to Engineering as Developer`  
‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `Add John Doe (john.doe@company.com) to Engineering as Developer`

Without email, you'll see: `‚ùå Tool failed: Missing required field: email`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ELISHA1994/mcp-llama-sqlite-bridge.git
cd mcp-llama-sqlite-bridge
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Pull the required Ollama model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

## Usage

### Option 1: Simple Demo

#### Starting the Simple Server
```bash
python server.py --server_type=sse
```

#### Running the Simple Client
```bash
python client.py
```

### Option 2: HR Management System

#### Starting the HR Server
```bash
python hr_server.py --server_type=sse
```

#### Running the HR Client
```bash
python hr_client.py
```

The client will:
1. Connect to the MCP server
2. Display available tools
3. Start an interactive session where you can use natural language to interact with the database

### Example Interactions

#### Simple Demo:
```
Enter your message: Add a person named John Doe who is 30 years old and works as an Engineer
Agent: Data has been successfully added to the database.

Enter your message: Show me all people in the database
Agent: Here are all the people in the database:
1. John Doe, 30 years old, Engineer
```

## Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError
If you encounter module import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Ollama Model Error
If you get an error about the model not supporting tools, ensure you're using a model that supports function calling (like llama3.2, mistral, or qwen2.5-coder).

### Connection Issues
Ensure the MCP server is running before starting the client.

### Employee Not Added Issue
If your command to add an employee doesn't work:
- **Check for email**: Email is REQUIRED. Without it, the employee won't be saved.
- **Look for error messages**: "‚ùå Tool failed: Missing required field: email"
- **Correct format**: `Add Name (email@company.com) to Department as Position`
- Always include email: firstname.lastname@company.com

### Tool Expects Employee ID Error
If you get errors when using employee names:
- **Use the simplified tools**: check_employee_leave_balance, update_employee_salary, submit_leave_request
- **These accept names directly**: "Check John Doe's leave balance"
- **Don't use**: get_leave_balance, update_salary, request_leave with names
- The simplified tools handle name-to-ID lookup automatically
